# Hackathon-1 
# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – Interactive Textbook  
### Built with Spec-Driven Development • Gemini-CLI • Docusaurus  
#### By **Fareaa Faisal**

---

## 📘 Overview

**Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** is a complete, production-grade interactive textbook designed for learners, researchers, and developers exploring humanoid robotics powered by **ROS 2**, **AI planning**, **LLMs**, and **multimodal robotic intelligence**.

This project was built for a hackathon where the requirement was to follow a strict **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** workflow using:

- **Gemini-CLI** for specification, architecture planning, file generation, and iterative refinement  
- **Docusaurus** for the full documentation site and interactive learning experience  
- **Modular, testable chapter structure** aligned with the spec-kit methodology  
- **Modern UI/UX** created by **Fareaa Faisal** with polished layout, visuals, and content flow  

The result is a clean, professional, and visually appealing robotics learning platform.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🔹 Fully Spec-Driven Architecture  
This project strictly follows **spec → plan → build → validate**, ensuring:

- Deterministic development  
- Clear module boundaries  
- Reproducibility  
- Consistent structure across every chapter  

### 🔹 Gemini-CLI Powered Development  
The entire textbook was generated, improved, and maintained using:

- `/sp.constitution` for the global structure  
- `/sp.module`, `/sp.chapter`, `/sp.plan`, `/sp.file` for iterative refinement  
- Automated architecture checks and content generation  

### 🔹 Interactive Documentation (Docusaurus)  
The site provides:

- Sidebar-based navigation  
- MDX support  
- Syntax highlighting  
- Custom UI elements  
- Mobile-friendly responsive layout  

### 🔹 Clean & Beautiful Interface  
Designed entirely by **Fareaa Faisal**, the UI includes:

- Aesthetic typography and spacing  
- Soft color palettes  
- Intuitive layout for modules and chapters  
- Consistent visual hierarchy  
- Smooth reading experience  

### 🔹 Robotics-Focused Content  
Includes deeply technical chapters on:

- ROS 2  
- Simulation  
- VLMs & VLA pipelines  
- LLM-to-ROS deterministic execution  
- Autonomous navigation  
- Manipulation  
- Multimodal fusion  
- Full autonomous humanoid architecture
