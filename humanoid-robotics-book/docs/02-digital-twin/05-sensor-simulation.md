## Sensor Simulation

This chapter covers configuring and reading simulated LiDAR, RGB, Depth, and IMU sensors.

### Requirements:
- Configure LiDAR, RGB, Depth, IMU.

### Success Criteria:
- Student reads simulated sensor topics.

---
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Configure and integrate various types of simulated sensors (LiDAR, RGB camera, Depth camera, IMU).
- Understand how to access and interpret simulated sensor data from ROS 2 topics.
- Apply simulated sensor data for perception tasks within the digital twin.
