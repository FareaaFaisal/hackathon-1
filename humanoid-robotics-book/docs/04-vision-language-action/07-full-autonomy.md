## Building a Fully Autonomous Humanoid

This chapter focuses on integrating all modules to achieve full autonomy.

### Requirements:
- Integrate all modules.

### Success Criteria:
- Robot performs a full autonomy loop.

---
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Integrate all previously learned modules (ROS 2, simulation, AI brain, VLA) into a single, cohesive system.
- Develop the necessary control logic and orchestration for a humanoid robot to operate autonomously.
- Demonstrate a fully autonomous humanoid performing complex tasks without human intervention.
