## Multimodal Pipeline

This chapter focuses on combining voice, vision, navigation, and manipulation into a unified ROS 2 + LLM system.

### Requirements:
- Combine voice, vision, navigation, manipulation.

### Success Criteria:
- Unified ROS 2 + LLM system.

---
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Integrate diverse modalities (voice, vision, navigation, manipulation) into a coherent robotic system.
- Develop a unified ROS 2 and LLM-based architecture for multimodal control.
- Achieve seamless interaction between different sensory inputs and action outputs in a humanoid robot.
