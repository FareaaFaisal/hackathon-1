## LLM Planning

This chapter focuses on converting natural language tasks into ROS 2 actions using Large Language Models (LLMs).

### Requirements:
- Convert natural language tasks into ROS 2 actions.

### Success Criteria:
- LLM produces step-by-step humanoid plans.

---
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated into robotic planning.
- Implement methods to translate natural language commands into a sequence of ROS 2 actions.
- Develop LLM-based planners that generate robust, step-by-step plans for humanoid robots.
