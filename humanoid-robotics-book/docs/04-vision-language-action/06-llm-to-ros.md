## LLM → ROS Action Execution

This chapter focuses on ensuring safety, deterministic output, and recovery rules when translating LLM plans into ROS actions.

### Requirements:
- Ensure safety, deterministic output, recovery rules.

### Success Criteria:
- Command “Pick up the cup” results in correct action.

---
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Develop mechanisms for safe and deterministic execution of LLM-generated plans as ROS actions.
- Implement recovery strategies for handling unexpected outcomes during LLM-to-ROS action translation.
- Validate that natural language commands accurately translate into desired robot behaviors.
