## Synthetic Data

This chapter focuses on generating labeled data, including segmentation, depth, and 2D/3D keypoints, for training perception models.

### Requirements:
- Generate labeled data: segmentation, depth, 2D/3D keypoints.

### Success Criteria:
- Dataset exported for ML.

---
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Utilize Isaac Sim's capabilities to generate high-quality synthetic datasets.
- Understand the process of labeling data for various perception tasks (segmentation, depth estimation, keypoint detection).
- Prepare and export synthetic datasets for machine learning model training.
