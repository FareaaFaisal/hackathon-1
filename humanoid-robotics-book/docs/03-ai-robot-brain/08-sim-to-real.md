## Sim-to-Real Transfer

This chapter discusses domain randomization and evaluation protocols for transferring simulated robot skills to the real world.

### Requirements:
- Domain randomization.
- Evaluation protocol.

### Success Criteria:
- Model performs similarly on Jetson.

---
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Understand the challenges and techniques involved in transferring robot skills from simulation to reality.
- Implement domain randomization strategies to improve model robustness for sim-to-real transfer.
- Develop and apply evaluation protocols to assess the performance of models on real hardware like NVIDIA Jetson.
